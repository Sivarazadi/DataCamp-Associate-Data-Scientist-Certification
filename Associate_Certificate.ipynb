I decided to investigate the age distribtution first to ensure that there was not a skewed distribution since I believed very young and very old customers to be more likely to not attendant the class. I found that there was not such skew in the age distribution and that it looked like a normal distribution with means of about 30. I then decided to investigate the attendance distribution, in which I found it right skewed and almost like two different distributions stacked onto each other. Since the distribution of attendance looked like two distributions stacked together, I decided to investigate the columns that had only two unique values. These columns would be the time and class capacity columns. \n","\n","Investigating the distribution of attendance with a hue of class capacity and a seperate hue of time, I found that the class capacity highly impacted the attendance while the time did not. Moving on from that, I investigated boxplots of the attendance of different class categories and I did not find a significant difference in attendance between them. I also looked at boxplots of the attendance for the number of days the class is fully booked before the class (also know as 'days_before') and I found that the more days the class is fully booked then the higher chance of more attendance. I then looked at two scatter plots of the proportion of new customers in a class and the age of the customer with a hue looking at class capacity. In the scatter plot of proportion of new customers and age, there wasn't much of a difference in attendance however looking at it with a hue showing class capacity, it is again obvious that the classes with a capacity of 25 have higher attendance. Looking at the age vs attendance scatterplot, there is a negative correlation between the two, however looking at the hue of class capacity, it shows that those who are older are more likely to go into the classes with only 15 capacity.\n","\n","Overall in my analysis I found that: \n","* variables most impactful on attendance are class_capacity, the number of days the class is fully booked before the class, and the age of the customers\n","* negative correlation between age and attendance\n","* older customers are more likely to go into a lower capacity class which could be the reason lower capacity classes have lower attendance or vice versa\n","\n","\n","The changes I made to my data to enable modeling was to change categorical data to numberical values since machine learning algorithms can't deal with categorical data.
